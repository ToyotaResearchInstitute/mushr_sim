# MuSHR Simulator
A simulation platform for MuSHR. A simulated car can be either controlled via keyboard teleoperation, or by control algorithm. This simulator is designed to emulate the car's configuration as close as possible to reduce sim-to-real overhead. To do so, many of the hardware components are programmatically simulated.

## Tutorials
Tutorials using the simulator can be found in the main [MuSHR repository](https://github.com/personalrobotics/mushr)
